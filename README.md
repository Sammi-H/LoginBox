LoginBox Project

This is a simple yet functional login and user profile management system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates key frontend development concepts, including form validation, user authentication, profile management, dark mode toggle, and localStorage usage to persist user data.

Features

User Authentication: Users can log in using a predefined username and password. Thereâ€™s an option to "Remember Me" that saves login credentials to localStorage for future sessions.
Profile Management: Users can view and edit their profile information, including name, email, role, and an optional profile image.
Password Reset: A simple flow to request a password reset by entering the user's email.
Dark Mode: Users can toggle between light and dark mode to change the theme of the application.
Profile Image Upload: Users can upload and delete their profile image.
Local Storage: User data (login credentials and profile information) is stored in localStorage, allowing users to persist their data across sessions.
Project Structure

HTML: The structure of the login page, profile page, and modals.
CSS: Basic styling for the pages, with a focus on simplicity and responsiveness. Includes styles for light and dark modes.
JavaScript: Handles all the functionality including login validation, storing user data in localStorage, modal management, and dark mode toggle.
Installation



Login: Enter a username and password. If the "Remember Me" checkbox is checked, the credentials will be saved for future use.
Profile Management: Once logged in, you can edit your profile (name, email, role, and about me) and upload a profile image.
Dark Mode: Toggle the dark mode switch to change the app's theme.
Sign Out: Log out and clear saved credentials from localStorage.

Technologies Used

HTML5: The structure of the web pages.
CSS3: For styling the user interface.
JavaScript: To implement the interactivity and functionality such as form validation, profile management, dark mode, etc.
localStorage: Used to store user data and maintain state between page reloads.
Future Improvements

Implement more secure password handling (e.g., hashing) for better user security.
Add user registration functionality to allow new users to create accounts.
Enhance form validation to provide more detailed error messages and prevent invalid inputs.
Improve UI/UX with animations and better error handling.
